### Fairytale creatures from the Bulgarian folklore

- Project made with Flexbox;
- Click over the bold names to see the source links;
- Can be improved further including JS, CSS animation;
- Pages from which I learned more: [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), [MDN documentation]( https://developer.mozilla.org/);

#### The code can be optimized
- to check HTML doc and clean it a bit;
- to check CSS doc and shorten it;
- to add comments;
