    <h2 class="title">Fairytale creatures from the Bulgarian folklore</h2>
    <p>There are many tales in the Bulgarian folklore that tell about the fantastic creatures
        inhabiting our land long time ago. Their images were always excited for the imagination and they are 
        still alive in our mind and houses. Yes, I wrote "in our houses", because everyone was grown up with them.
        They live in the Bulgarian home where the parents teach the children what is good or bad throw the creatures.
        Not only this, but they are presented also in some of our traditions, believes and mythological stories.

        <h2 class="about">More about the fairy creatures</h2>
        <p class="text">Slavic Spirits are provisionally called all the supernatural beings who, according to the Slavs, 
        inhabit the world around them. The Slavs themselves most often call these beings demons, which in 
        pre-Christian times denotes absolutely all spirits, demons, etc., regardless of their functions 
        and character (good or evil). In essence, they are different from the gods. Godsare all-powerful, 
        they embody the basic characteristics of nature or of human nature and social life, and can accordingly
        guide and model everything in the World Tree - life, death, love, marriage, birth, disease, fertility,
        misery, strength, weakness, rains, droughts, earthquakes, light, darkness, heat, cold, etc. 
        All their actions give rise to some concern for humanity or nature, no matter how it manifests itself
        in this particular case - as a benefit or as a harm. Care here is not necessarily in the interest of 
        man, it is not only aimed at his well-being, but somehow has a certain lasting focus on maintaining a 
        basic universal principle. All demons, spirits, souls and other supernatural creatures are much more elemental, 
        inferior and powerful. True, they have one or the other magical possibilities, but these 
        possibilities are in a rather narrow field and are used to achieve a very minor effect, which is more a 
        projection of the instantaneous whim of the creature than a manifestation of a purposeful pursuit of anything 
        it was. Apart from all this, supernatural beings mentioned below are themselves subordinate to the gods, 
        though to a lesser extent than humans. They are not so vitally dependent on divine benevolence, but are 
        compelled to obey it in order not to be subjected to "heavenly punishment" and it is their punishment that 
        distinguishes them from divine powers that are generally unpunishable. And if the gods are mostly the object
        of religious beliefs and reverence, then the other supernatural beings are subject only to mythology and 
        superstition. Therefore, humans are only afraid of them, as they fear beasts and diseases, while they treat 
        gods with awe, respect, and even love. Some of them are: wood-nymph (Samodiva), snake (Zmei), llama (Lamya),
        vampires and goblins (Thalassam).</p>

        are terribly beautiful, eternally young girls, with a thin body, long hair, white dress and a magical look that dazzles and even kills.
        When they go to bathe, they become ordinary girls, the legends tell. Exactly such moments are used by brave guys who steal them and marry them. 
        The Samodiva has a magical dance and sings around the wells. These creatures live in hard-to-reach high mountain forests, where each of them takes 
        care of a forest animal, tree, flower, shrub or mountain stream, jealously protecting it, mainly from human damage. They have extensive knowledge of 
        nature and herbs, know how to heal as well as other secrets about the world.</p>

        sharp nails and teeth, and one or more canine heads on serpentine necks. According to the legend, her 
        mouth is so wide that it can swallow a person or a prey. Her body is covered with yellow flakes, symbol
        of bile and poison. <a href="https://vezba.bg/blogs/vezba/prikazni-sazdaniya-bulgarski-folklor" target="_blank" class="source-link">The Lamya</a> is common in folk songs and tales. Most of the images have three, seven or 
        nine identical heads. It lives at the bottom of the sea or in empty forests, stopping the waters of wells, 
        rivers and lakes, just like the Zmei. A sacrifice must be made, in order to appease the Lamya.  
        Despite her scary appearance, the heroes fight her and defeat her by cutting off her heads. 
        Such hero in the Bulgarian folklore is Krali Marko. The enemy of the Lamya is the Zmei.</p>

        with scales. In Slavic mythology, the Zmei is also described as a huge, ugly three-headed snake 
        that kills with the power of its muscular torso. He lives in inhabits forests and high mountains 
        as per our tales. He is like a man in many ways: he eats, drinks, marries, has offspring, dies. Although they have 
        snakes of their own, these creatures often fall in love with girls and start secretly visiting them at night. 
        Such women begin to be alienated by others, do not care for their appearance, fade and fall away 
        because the insatiable lover drinks their powers. Then they have children who look like humans but 
        have wings under their arms and extraordinary strength.<a href="https://vezba.bg/blogs/vezba/prikazni-sazdaniya-bulgarski-folklor" target="_blank" class="source-link"> The Zmei</a> is a natural enemy of the Lamya.</p>

        January is called the Karakondzh month. These creatures often sit at intersections and talk up late 
        passengers, asking riddles or asking for services. If a person treats them with kindness and good will,

        rivers or desolate places. He can also settle in inaccessible places of houses - for example, in the attic. 
        The Bulgarians protected themselves by carrying garlic and wormwood under the clothes. In Bulgaria, the Kukers 
        chase the Karakondzhul as well as other evil forces.</p>

        buildings. During the day he hides in the attic, in the cellar or in the outbuildings of the

        wandering spirit seek peace, shelter, and when he finds a suitable home, it can be hard to get 
        him out of there. On the contrary, goblins do their best to drive away the people in whose house

        him to a pre-cooked meal and tell him they are celebrating a wedding. Sweet as he stands on the table,
        one has to get up and say that it is time to go to the wedding party, and then take the Thalassam to 
        a remote hut in the forest. When they reach the designated hut, the man opens the door, invites the Thalassam inside, leaves
        him some food, and knits the yarn knotted, saying that he will find the wedding guests to bring 
        them, and locks the door from the outside. It is believed that goblins are a homebody and can not tolerate 
        unfinished homework and handiwork around. However, it is dangerous, wandering through the 
        forest, to enter a foreign huts, because if the Thalassam is left there, it will go after you.</p>

        it is simply a Slavic name for a witch. Used to scare children when they are disobedient. The threat is that 
        Baba Yaga will come to take them in a big bag. In our mythology, her image is associated with evil spells. 
        Young children are scared of her because she eats them in large bowls or for the older children, because she 
        can make a magic to them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_Man" target="_blank" class="source-link">The Sack Man</a> (also called the Bag Man or Man with the Bag/Sack) is a figure similar 
        to the bogeyman, portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away. In Bulgaria, 
        children are sometimes told that a dark scary monster-like person called Torbalan will come and kidnap them 
        with his large sack if they misbehave. He can be seen as the antipode of the Christmas figure Dyado Koleda 
        (corresponding to Father Christmas).

        <p class="text"><a href="https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0" target="_blank" class="source-link">The Hala</a> is a mythological female creature in the folklore of Bulgarians and Serbs, 
            including Slavic-speaking inhabitants of northern Macedonia. In folk tales, the Halas
            are demons - the personification of some natural elements (storm, fog, whirlwind, 
            hail). Their main goal is to bring cloud over gardens, fields, vineyards and orchards and to 
            destroy the crop or to plunder it and take it with them. The Halas are extremely greedy creatures and 
            are especially fond of eating children, but their greed is not limited to Earth. Being in a 
            good relationship with the Hala brings many benefits - it can make a person rich and come to 
            their aid when needed. The Halas are believed to live in clouds or lakes, springs, hidden remote 
            places, forests, inaccessible mountains, caves or in giant trees. The Hala has several enemies,
            including the Zmei, the serpent-like people, the eagles, St. Elijah and St. Sava. The main opponent of 
            the Hala is the Zmei; it is capable of overcoming it and eliminating its harmful influence. From this 
            point of view, the folklore serpents(the Zmei) are seen as defenders of the fields and crops, as well as 
            guardians against bad weather. When the Hala threatens the village by bringing in clouds, the Zmei comes 
            to fight her and chase her away. His main weapon is lightning; thunderstorms express the battle 
            between the Halas and the Zmeiove (in which the Halas sometimes hide in large trees).

            in traditional culture is perceived as a result of disturbed socio-cultural norms and supernatural interventions. In pre-industrial 
            society, the disease is attributed to a number of disease-causing demons. High child mortality in the past has caused people to 
            often think that the children were victims of different demonic beings. The same is true for high maternal mortality.
            Some of the demon deseases are:
            <ul>
                <li>&#10141; <em>The Lehusnik</em> is disease-causing demons that, according to popular beliefs, harm births by causing birth fever.</li>
                <li>&#10141; The name <em>Gorska maika</em>(forest mother) denotes a pathogenic demon that causes insomnia in children. This childhood illness is also called a <em>noshtnica</em>.</li>
                <li>&#10141; Another morbid demon in Bulgarian folk beliefs is the <em>Morata</em>.</li>
                <li>&#10141; <em>The Chervenka</em> is the folk name of the disease red wind.</li>
                <li>&#10141; The worst epidemic of the past, <em>the Chuma</em>(the plague), is also being demonized.</li>
                <li>&#10141; With <em>Treska</em> in the past the Bulgarians usually termed malaria. According to folk tales, The Treska live on the edge of the world.</li>
                <li>&#10141; The disease <em>Sharka</em> in the past is also demonized and the people named her - <em>auntie, granny, goska, sweet and honey</em>, and is known by the name <em>sipka</em>.</li>
